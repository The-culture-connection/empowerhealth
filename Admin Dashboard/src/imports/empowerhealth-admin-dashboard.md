Design an Admin Dashboard Web App UI for a maternal health platform called EmpowerHealth.

The dashboard should feel:

• Calm
• Warm
• Trustworthy
• Research-grade
• Not corporate or clinical
• Designed for mission-driven organizations

Use soft rounded components, muted purples, warm neutrals, and generous whitespace.

Avoid sharp edges, harsh blues, or “hospital system” aesthetics.
