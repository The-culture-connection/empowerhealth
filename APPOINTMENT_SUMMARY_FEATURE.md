# Appointment Visit Summary Feature - Complete Implementation

## ✅ All Features Implemented

### 1. **Responsive "EmpowerHealth" Title** ✅

**Problem:** Title text was too large and overflowed on smaller devices

**Solution:**
- Wrapped in `FittedBox` widget
- Font size scales with device width: `MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.18`
- Automatically adjusts to fit any screen size
- Maintains aspect ratio and readability

**File:** `lib/auth/auth_screen.dart`

**Result:**
- ✅ Works on all device sizes
- ✅ Always fits on one line
- ✅ Maintains beautiful cursive font
- ✅ No overflow errors

---

### 2. **After-Visit Summary Firebase Function** ✅

**New Function:** `summarizeAfterVisitPDF`

**What It Does:**
1. Receives PDF text from uploaded visit summary
2. Calls OpenAI API with specialized prompt
3. Generates structured summary with 4 sections:
   - **How Your Baby Is Doing** - Fetal health, measurements, heartbeat
   - **How You Are Doing** - Maternal health, vitals, symptoms
   - **Actions To Take** - Medications, lifestyle changes, appointments
   - **Suggested Learning Topics** - 2-3 relevant modules based on visit

**Personalization:**
- ✅ Adjusts to user's education level (5th-8th grade)
- ✅ Uses professional clinical language
- ✅ Avoids casual terms like "momma"
- ✅ Clear, actionable information

**Storage:**
- Saved to: `users/{userId}/visit_summaries/{summaryId}`
- Includes: appointmentDate, originalText, summary, readingLevel, createdAt

**File:** `functions/index.js`

---

### 3. **Appointments List Screen** ✅

**Screens:** **`AppointmentsListScreen`** + **`VisitDetailScreen`** (`lib/appointments/visit_detail_screen.dart`) — matches **NewUI** `MyVisits.tsx` / `VisitDetail.tsx` (full-page detail, not a popup).

**List features:**
- ✅ **Single scroll:** header, reassurance card, visit sections, and **“Notes from past visits”** footer all scroll together (`SingleChildScrollView`, max width ~672)
- ✅ Title **My Visits** with subtitle and reassurance card; **Most recent visit** / **Past visits** sections
- ✅ Summaries ordered by **`createdAt`** (newest first), same-day duplicates merged; soft cards and preview text
- ✅ **Preview line** uses `lib/appointments/visit_summary_preview.dart`: prefers structured **`summaryData`** (or a Map stored in **`summary`**) so list rows never show a raw `{questionsToAsk: ...}` string; corrupt string-only blobs are skipped in favor of structured fields or an empty preview
- ✅ Tap row → **`VisitDetailScreen`**: purple header, About, What was discussed, Actions, **Questions to ask next time**, **Notes** (from AI `visitNotes` in `summaryData`), suggested learning, reminder
- ✅ **Plus (+)** → upload flow
- ✅ Real-time Firestore updates

**AI:** `functions/index.js` — JSON includes **`questionsToAsk`** and **`visitNotes`**; `formatSummaryForDisplay` writes `## Notes` bullets into the stored summary string.

**Home tab:** **`HomeScreenV2`** uses **`orderBy('createdAt').limit(1)`** on **`visit_summaries`** so the **My Visits** widget always reflects the latest summarized visit, with a short preview line when summary text exists.

**File:** `lib/appointments/appointments_list_screen.dart`

---

### 4. **Upload Visit Summary Screen** ✅

**Aligned with NewUI** `UploadVisitSummary.tsx`: warm background, soft blurs, back link to **My Visits**, title **After-Visit Support**, privacy gradient card (shield), **Appointment date** section with calendar card, **Upload PDF** / **Type Text** pills, dashed-style upload card with **Take photo** (camera), **Gallery**, and **Choose file** (PDF or image → single-page PDF via Syncfusion), processing info card, text mode with **Process Notes** CTA. Screen copy states literacy support (not diagnosis) and names document types (after-visit summary, discharge paperwork, provider notes). **Your privacy (plain language)** opens **`AfterVisitPrivacyScreen`** from the main body and from the one-time transparency dialog.

**Flow:**
1. **Select Appointment Date** (`showDatePicker`, formatted in the card)
2. **Upload** or **Type Text** — camera, gallery, or file picker (PDF, JPG, PNG, HEIC, WebP); images are wrapped into one PDF page for the same Cloud Function pipeline
3. **Process & Analyze** (existing Cloud Function + Storage flow unchanged)
4. **View Summary** (markdown + disclaimer)
5. Summaries stored under **`visit_summaries`** as today

**How the feature works (upload & privacy):**
- **`_imageBytesToTempPdf`** builds a full-page PDF from image bytes for any image-based path.
- **Transparency dialog** can deep-link to **`lib/privacy/after_visit_privacy_screen.dart`** before dismiss.
- **Result section cards** use the **exact `##` heading** from the generated markdown as each card’s purple label (so “Important Next Steps” and “Suggested Learning Topics” stay distinct—not a fixed three-title rotation that reused “Questions you may want to ask”).
- **Visit detail** (`VisitDetailScreen`) supports user deletion of summaries and related uploads; see dossier §4 in **`admindash/FEATURES.md`** for the full After-Visit Support contract.

**UI Features:**
- ✅ No purple app bar; **Navigator** back row + `AppTheme.backgroundWarm`
- ✅ Privacy + appointment + method toggle + upload/text panels match NewUI spacing and radii (~24–28)

**File:** `lib/appointments/upload_visit_summary_screen.dart`

---

### 5. **Service Layer Integration** ✅

Added new method to `FirebaseFunctionsService`:

```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> summarizeAfterVisitPDF({
  required String pdfText,
  required String appointmentDate,
  String? educationLevel,
})
```

**File:** `lib/services/firebase_functions_service.dart`
